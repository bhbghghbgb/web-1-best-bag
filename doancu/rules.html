                <p><b>Bumping:</b> Your account will be banned if you keep deleting and reposting your torrents.</p>
                <p><b>Flooding:</b> If you have five or more releases of the same type to release in one go, make a
                    batch torrent containing all of them.</p>
                <p><b>URL redirection services:</b> These are removed on sight along with their torrents.</p>
                <p><b>Advertising:</b> No.</p>
                <p><b>Content restrictions:</b> This site is for content that originates from and/or is specific to

                    <li>
                        <p>DVD source video is limited to 1024x576p.</p>

                        <p>TV source video is by default limited to 1920x1080p.
                            <!-- The BS11, BS-NTV, NHK-BS Premium, and WOWOW channels are limited to 1920x1080p.--> SD
                            channels, however, are limited to 480p.

                </ul><br>
                <p>Naturally, untouched sources are not bound by these limits. Leaks are also not subject to any

                <p><b>A few notes concerning tagging and using other people's work:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Do not add your own tag(s) when reuploading an original release.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Unless you are reuploading an original release, you should either avoid using tags that are
                            not your own or make it extremely clear to everyone that you are the one responsible for the
                            upload.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If these policies are not obeyed, then those torrents will be removed if reported by a group
                            or person commonly seen as the owner of the tag(s). This especially applies to remake
                            torrents.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Although only hinted at above, we may remove troll torrents tagged with A-sucks, B-is-slow,
                            or such if reported by A or B.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remakes which are utterly bit rate-starved are not allowed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remakes which add watermarks or such are not allowed.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Remakes which reencode video to XviD or worse are not allowed.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Remakes of JPG/PNG-based releases are not allowed without exceptions since there is most
                            often no point in making such.</p>
