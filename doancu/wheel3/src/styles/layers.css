/* Define the CSS layer order.
   It establishes the global cascade order for all named layers.

   - 'theme': For Tailwind's theme-related styles and variables.
   - 'base': For general resets (like Tailwind's Preflight) and your foundational styles (your base.css).
   - 'vuetify': For Vuetify's core styles and components.
   - 'components': For your own custom components, or if other libraries define components.
   - 'utilities': For Tailwind's utility classes. By placing this last,
     we ensure Tailwind's utilities have the highest precedence in the layer cascade.
